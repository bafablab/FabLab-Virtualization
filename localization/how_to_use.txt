How to edit translations CSV in LibreOffice Calc:

-Import settings:
--Character encoding UTF-8
--Language doesn't matter, english or finnish is fine
--Separator is comma/pilkku
--IMPORTANT: Other options: Check the box about quote marks "Lainausmerkit muotoilevat tekstin√§"

-After saving from LibreOffice Calc you might want to check the CSV file in a text editor (Notepad++) to check that no mystery quote marks or anything else has broken the file
-The CSV file should look like this, note the type of quotes used:
"DEV_DESC_INNOV","[b]Embroidering machine[/b] desc","[b]Brodeerauskone[/b] selite","Embroidering machine desc"
"DEV_DESC_JUKI_MO","[b]Overlocker MO[/b] desc","[b]Saumuri MO[/b] selite","Overlocker MO desc"
"DEV_DESC_JUKI_MSC","[b]Overlocker MSC[/b] desc","[b]Saumuri MSC[/b] selite","Overlocker MSC desc"
"DEV_DESC_NOVA","[b]Sand blaster[/b] desc","[b]Hiekkapuhallin[/b] selite","Sand blaster desc"


About the strings themselves:
-Current string key model is ALL_CAPS_WITH_UNDERSCORE
-Supported languages are en, fi, sv
-Devices have DEV_NAME_ and DEV_DESC_, other items have ITEM_NAME_ and ITEM_DESC_, if more strings are needed, name them in a similar fashion
-UI strings are named NAME_OF_WINDOW_WHATSTRINGISIT, like MAIN_MENU_TITLE or DEV_MENU_INFO

Usage in Godot:
-Godot translation server should automatically translate keys when it sees them in attributes or in code, if not, you can use tr("NAME_OF_STRING") in scripts to force it
