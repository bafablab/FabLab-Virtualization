How to edit translations CSV in LibreOffice Calc (Excel seems to mess up the file, don't use that):
-Import settings:
--Character encoding UTF-8
--Language doesn't matter, english or finnish is fine
--Separator is comma/pilkku
--IMPORTANT: Other options: Check the box about quote marks "Lainausmerkit muotoilevat tekstin√§"
-After saving from LibreOffice Calc you might want to check the CSV file in a text editor (Notepad++) to check that no mystery quote marks or anything else has broken the file

How to edit translations in a text editor:
-It's a bit messy looking, but the format is quite simple and standard CSV.
-The CSV file should look like this, note the type of quotes used:

"DEV_DESC_INNOV","[b]Embroidering machine[/b] desc","[b]Brodeerauskone[/b] selite","Embroidering machine desc"
"DEV_DESC_JUKI_MO","[b]Overlocker MO[/b] desc","[b]Saumuri MO[/b] selite","Overlocker MO desc"
"DEV_DESC_JUKI_MSC","[b]Overlocker MSC[/b] desc","[b]Saumuri MSC[/b] selite","Overlocker MSC desc"
"DEV_DESC_NOVA","[b]Sand blaster[/b] desc","[b]Hiekkapuhallin[/b] selite","Sand blaster desc"

So:

"STRING_KEY","english text","finnish text","swedish text"
"STRING_KEY_2","english text","finnish text","swedish text"

Just commas separating the fields and a newline after every line.

Multiline texts are possible and common:

"MULTILINE_STRING","english line 1
english line 2","finnish line 1
finnish line 2","swedish line 1
swedish line 2"

Obviously, don't use "-characters inside the strings.

About the strings themselves:
-Current string key model is ALL_CAPS_WITH_UNDERSCORE
-Supported languages are en, fi, sv
-Devices have DEV_NAME_, DEV_GENERIC_NAME_, DEV_DESC_, items have ITEM_NAME_ and ITEM_DESC_, genericinfos have INFO_NAME_, INFO_HEADER_, INFO_TEXT_
-UI strings are named NAME_OF_WINDOW_WHATSTRINGISIT, like MAIN_MENU_TITLE or DEV_MENU_INFO, there are also general strings used everywhere, like BUTTON_CLOSE

----
Usage in Godot:
-Godot translation server should automatically translate keys when it sees them in attributes or in code, if not, you can use tr("NAME_OF_STRING") in scripts to force it. This is needed in RichTextLabels, for example. You see tr() used in the scripts a lot because of this.
