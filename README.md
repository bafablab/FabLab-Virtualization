# Virtual FabLab

Virtual FabLab is a virtual version of [BusinessAsema Oulu's](https://businessasema.com/en/) [FabLab](https://businessasema.com/en/fablab/) created in the [Godot game engine](https://godotengine.org/) (version 3.5.2). FabLab facilities, furniture, devices and a few example products have been modeled into the environment.

The user can interact with FabLab's devices, example products and a couple of other items. By clicking on devices and products the user can learn more about them. Some objects can also be moved around in the environment.

This virtual model is meant to be used either as a HTML5 version, or as a native Windows/MacOS/Linux application. HTML5 and Windows builds are provided in releases.

Virtual FabLab has been developed as a part of [BusinessOulu's](https://www.businessoulu.com/en/) [Et√§Asema-project](https://www.businessoulu.com/fi/businessoulu/ohjelmat-ja-hankkeet/etaasema-hanke.html).
